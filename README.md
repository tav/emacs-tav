Tav's Emacs Setup
-----------------

This is the Emacs setup I've built up since early 2000. I've trimmed it over  
time to only include the features that I actually use, so it should be pretty  
lean and minimal.

**Installation**

    git clone https://github.com/tav/emacs-tav ~/.emacs.d
    ln -s ~/.emacs.d/init.el ~/.emacs

**License**

I hereby dedicate all of my code inside `init.el` to the Public Domain, so use  
it however you wish.

Enjoy, tav <<tav@espians.com>>
